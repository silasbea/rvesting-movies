# Harvesting IMDB Movies with RVest in R
Here, we harvest movies from the URL https://imdb.com/chart/top for the top 250 movies as rated by IMDB.

R packages such as RVest, Dplyr, Stringr are used to fetch, clean and process the data and then the tibble package is used to generate a tibble which is essentially a data frame or the dataset formed, if you like. 

The last code chunk writes the tibble data to a CSV format which is also seen in the files here in the repo.
